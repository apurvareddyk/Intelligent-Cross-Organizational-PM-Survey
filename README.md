## What is Process Mining?

Process mining extracts and analyzes event logs from systems to create process models, optimize workflows, and uncover inefficiencies. Key steps include:
1. **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)**: Event logs are cleaned and stored for analysis.
2. **Modeling**: AI-driven models create workflows from logs.
3. **Deployment**: Optimized models are deployed to evaluate and enhance processes.

The workflow of the proposed Intelligent Cross-organizational Process Mining. Specifically, for different application scenarios, the system uses federated learning and distributed computing to improve data privacy, adaptability to cross-organizational event logs, and system efficiency. Next, clustering is applied to classify different sub-tasks by the event log’s similarity and correlation. AutoML is then used to model each sub-task to further optimize the system’s robustness to multi-task and adaptability to multi-model data. Finally, the system is combined with LLM for performance diagnosis and deployment.
